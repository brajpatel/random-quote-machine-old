# Random Quote Machine
This app displays a random quote and its quotee from an array of quotes. On each press of the 'new quote' button, the color of the page will randomly change too. Additionally, there are buttons that enable users to quickly access Twitter, to make a tweet, or Instagram, to create a story.

#### How to install:
- Download the code as a ZIP file
- Extract all
- Open the 'index.html' file in your desired web browser
